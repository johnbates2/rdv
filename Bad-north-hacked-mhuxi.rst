Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red.  · Our Bad North +7 trainer is now available for version and supports STEAM. These Bad North cheats are designed to enhance your experience with the game. 1. Grab a hex editor (e.g. HexFiend), open campaign - 0. file (or whatever save-game number you need), the location differs by system and store. Go to offset 0x and remember to select Overwrite mode in your editor. Two bytes there are your gold amount (little-endian, at least on my system). I.e. 0x14 00 is 20 gold, 0xFF 00 would be gold.
