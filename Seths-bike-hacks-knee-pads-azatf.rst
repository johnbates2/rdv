Seth's Bike Hacks November 8, · Use your thru axle for leverage, use a suspension pump to break loose a tight air cap, summon a trail guide by peeing, and other wacky bike hacks! Welcome back to Berm Peak! I’m Seth, and this is our official merch store, hosted by Cognative MTB. We have worked closely with Cognative to design products you’ll actually wear and use. Every shirt is the most comfortable cut and material we could find, and the screen prints are done by hand only minutes from Berm Peak. In short, we only offer stuff we’re proud of, so you’ll be . Seth's Bike Hacks. All of our Teeshirts and Stickers have now moved to Cognative MTB Shop now at Cognative MTB.
