Welcome back to Berm Peak! I’m Seth, and this is our official merch store, hosted by Cognative MTB. We have worked closely with Cognative to design products you’ll actually wear and use. Every shirt is the most comfortable cut and material we could find, and the screen prints are done by hand only minutes from Berm Peak. In short, we only offer stuff we’re proud of, so you’ll be . PLEASE DO NOT SEND anything large, like bikes, ebikes, or wheels without contacting us first. No nutrition, food, or medical supplies will be reviewed or accepted under any circumstances ever. You can submit a request, or simply mail your product to the following address.
