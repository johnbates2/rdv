Seth’s Bike Hacks, Inc. 30 Westgate Parkway # Asheville, NC  Seth's review and video sold me. Definitely an improvement over the stock forks on my Schwinn Boundary. They weigh just over a pound lighter than the OEM fork. Love the rebound damper, lockout works well but wish the dampening setting wasn't so /5.
