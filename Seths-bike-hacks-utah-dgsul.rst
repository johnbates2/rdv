I'm Seth, and Berm Peak is my backyard! We're turning my backyard into a super miniature downhill mountain bike park, and making family-friendly video content in the process. In . Seth from Seth's Bike Hacks is not a good MTB rider. I'm tired of people worshiping him like he's a biking god. He rides cheap bikes, does not ride gnarly stuff nearly at all, and crashes in almost every video. Yes, everyone crashes. But if you've been riding as long as he has you should not be that often. He is a skilled mechanic but how hard even is that?  · If I’m spending $ on a bike it’s going to have an engine in it. 7. Utah. He is not a pro. He even says he is not a pro. He is a average biker that makes super good videos. Seth's Bike Hacks, Asheville, North Carolina., likes · 11, talking about this.
