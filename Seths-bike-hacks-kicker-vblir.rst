Seth's Bike Hacks. All of our Teeshirts and Stickers have now moved to Cognative MTB Shop now at Cognative MTB. I got the idea from a couple of videos by Phil Metz and Seth's Bike Hacks. Blake builds a mini kicker. The Loam Ranger has free plans for an adjustable ramp which is really cool. Seth's bike hacks has built all kinds of things. By adding some bike ramps to your driveway, a manual machine to your patio, How To Build a Kicker Ramp (via Seth's Bike Hacks).  · I am motivated by a recent jump crash to improve my jumping skills. I really like Blake Sampson's (@zimblake of GMBN fame) and Seth's Bike Hacks (@sethsbikeh.
