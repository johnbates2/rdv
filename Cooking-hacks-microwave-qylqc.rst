 · 5 Microwave Quick Meal Hacks. While it’s unfair to say that the best countertop microwave would be the preferred cooking tool for all types of food, there are many ways to use a microwave for making quick meals.. You won’t be able to make a fancy steak or a very complicated dish, of course. This is a quick and easy chocolate cake you can cook in the microwave in 2 minutes. And it tastes great. Really! The consistency is dense and cakey. It would go well with chocolate (or your favorite) chips, nuts, or served warm with hot fudge. This cake, 'born' out of a pregnancy craving, worked out amazingly!  · A microwave, used properly, can actually make you an even better cook. It can cut down on cooking times, save you from using multiple dishes, and achieve exactly the same textures as other methods.
